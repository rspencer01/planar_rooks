This repository contains a very rough and incredibly verbose attempt to derive a theory of the representation theory of Planar Rook Algebras.

For an introduction see [[FHH08]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.3960). The representation theory link to algebraic groups (outside scope but motivating) can be read in [[BM12]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.2482) and homological motivation (also outside scope) can be found in [[Kho12]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1101.0293).

This project will aim to show the cellularity of the algebras and that their representation theory depends only on whether δ is nonzero.
